//! <b> Operator splitting RK2 integrator, second order accurate in time </b>
/*!
  @par
    Integrator deals with the flux and source using Strang splitting, first
  adding have a source term, then performing the two stages as a result of the
  flux integration, and the finally adding the dsecond half of the contribution
  of the source. See Font 2008 Section 4.1

  @note
    This is a fully explicit method at dealing with the source contributions,
  do not expect this integrator to converge for large source contributions, i.e.
  for sources that act on a fast timescale compared to the flux terms. For stiff
  hyperbolic systems, we need to solve the sources implicitly to ensure stability.

  @par
    First, add half a source,
    \f{align}{
      U^{*} = U^n + \frac{1}{2} \Delta t \Psi(U^n)
    \f}
    then perform the RK2 step,
    \f{align}{
      U^{**} = \frac{1}{2} U^* + \frac{1}{2} U^{(1)} + \frac{1}{2} \Delta t \mathcal{F}(U^{(1)})
    \f}
    where the first stage result is
    \f{align}{
      U^{(1)} = U^* + \Delta t \mathcal{F}(U^*),
    \f}
    and then adds the source due to this stage,
    \f{align}{
      U^{n+1} = U^** + \Delta t \Psi(U^**),
    \f}
    where \f$\Psi(U)\f$ is the source vector due to the state \f$U\f$.
