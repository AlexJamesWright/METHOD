  @par
    Class contains all the data of the simulation relevant to any of the other
  modules. Containing it in this way prevents issues of cyclic includes, also
  results in Simulation as more of an interface than a class that needs to be
  known to lower objects---good practice. <br>

  Usage <br>
  =========
  @par
    Call the constructor with at least: the number of cells and domain limits in
  the x, y, and z direction, and the simulation end time. As ghost cells are
  automatically added to the domain, there would be a minimum number of total cells
  in any direction of nine---as a result, running 2D simulations would be 9x slower
  than necessary. To combat this, you can request zero cells in the z-direction
  which is equivalent to a 2D domain where Nz=1. Keep this behaviour in mind when
  constructing new models.
  @par
    Other variables, such as the courant factor, can also be set in the constructor
  but by default have sensible values that should work for most set ups, these can
  largely be ignored unless the simulation is failing to converge. <br>
  @par
    Selecting a model will automatically set the number of cons prims and aux vars,
  both inside the model class and in the data class (although it is the data class
  values that are accessed by the various functions). <br>
  @par
    The elementID function data.id(var, i, j, k) is a useful shortcut for accessing
  data belonging to a specific cell, where var is the id of the variable in the array
  we wish to access, and \f$(i, j, k)\f$ corresond to the\f$ (x, y, z)\f$ coordinates of the
  cell we wish to access. Note: this includes ghost cells, so in practice these values
  can range from \f$ 0 \le (i,j,k) < (nx,ny,nz)+2 Ng \f$ or \f$0 \le (i,j,k) < (Nx,Ny,Nz) \f$
  assuming we are working in 3D. To speed up this method, however, we have defined
  a macro in each file with the same functionality <br>
  For 2D simulations, k=0 at all times, and similarly j=0 for 1D simulations.

      In general, the conductivity may depend upon the environment (e.g. density,
    magnetic field strength etc.). This is the interface for calculating the
    conductivity. REALLY, this should be made as its own class and passed to the
    physics model, but I'm being lazy this once because thesis+timeline=reasons.
    Maybe a task for the interested reader...?
