//! <b> Flux vector splitting method </b>
/*!
  @par
    The flux vector splitting method, initial proposed in Shu 1997. Here,
  we use a second order WENO spatial reconstruction. <br>
  @par
    Here we outline the method briefly, but for a detailed explanation see
  the above citation. Ignoring any contributions to the conserved vector due to
  source terms we can define the system of conservation equations in the following
  form,
  \f{align}{
    \partial_t U + \partial_x f(U) = 0.
  \f}
  @par
    In essence we desire some numerical flux function \f$\mathcal{F}\f$ such that
  we can update the conserved vector in the following way,
  \f{align}{
    \partial_t U = \mathcal{F}(U)
  \f}
  such that
  \f{align}{
    U^{n+1} =& U^n + \Delta t \mathcal{F}(U) \\
            =& U^n + \Delta t \frac{f_{i+1/2} - f_{i-1/2}}{\Delta x}
  \f}
  where we define \f$f_{i+1/2}\f$ as the value of the flux vector at the righthand
  edge of the \f$i^{th}\f$ cell, and each cell has width \f$\Delta x\f$. To determine
  the value of the numerical flux function then, we need estimates of the values of
  the flux vector at the cell faces.
  @par
    To get these, we consider the flux in cell \f$i\f$ to be composed of
  entirely left moving and entirely right moving contributions, that is,
  \f{align}{
    f_i = f_i^- + f_i^+.
  \f}
  Using the Lax-Friedrichs approximation of the flux, we can ensure that these
  contributions are entirely poitive/negative by using the following,
  \f{align}{
    f_i^{\pm} = \frac{1}{2}(f_i \pm \alpha U_i)
  \f}
  where we have defined \f$\alpha = max_p|\lambda_p|\f$ is the maximum wavespeed
  with \f$\lambda_p\f$ as the \f$p^th\f$ eigenvalue of the Jacobian of the system.
  @par
    For simplicity, we note that in a system with electromagnetic perturbations, waves
  travel at the speed of light, and thus we set \f$alpha=1\f$ throughout. To
  determine the flux vector at the cell faces, we reconstruct both upwind and
  downwind fluxes and compute the difference of the two at the face. We do this
  with a second order WENO reconstruction, thus,
  \f{align}{
    f^+_{i, right} &= WENO(f_{i-2}, f_{i-1}, f_i) \\
    f^-_{i, left} &= WENO(f_{i+1}, f_i, f_{i-1})
  \f}
  so that the reconstruction if \f$f_{i+1/2} = f^+_{i, right} + f^-_{i, left}\f$.
  Note that this final equation is essentially a difference equation as the fluxes
  are moving in opposing directions.

  @note
      In the code, we have absorbed a minus into the definition of the numerical
    flux, and so where it says \f$U^n + \Delta t \mathcal{F}(U^{(n)})\f$, the code
    actually implements \f$cons - dt * flux\f$.
