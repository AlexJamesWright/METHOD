//! <b> Semi-implicit second order Runge-Kutta time integrator </b>
/*!
@par
    Integrator deals with the flux contribution explicitly and the source terms
  implicitly. Soecifically, the explicit step is performed by a second order
  RK method, and the implicit is a backwards euler formulism. <br>
@par
    The form of the forward step is TVD second order RK2. Such that the intermediate
  state due to the flux contribution is <br>
  \f{align}{
    U^* = RK2(U^n)
  \f}
  with the source contribution determined via a backwards Euler step, <br>
  \f{align}{
    U^{n+1} = U^* + \Psi(U^{n+1})
  \f}
  where \f$\Psi(U)\f$ is the source vector due to the conserved vector \f$U\f$.
@par
    The backwards step is solved using a multidimensional newton secant method,
  which we've implemented using the hydr1 rootfinder available [here](<https://github.com/devernay/cminpack>).
